                <h4> Our commitment to privacy</h4>
                <p>Protecting consumer privacy is very important to us. Our online Privacy Statement is available to inform you about our use and disclosure of personal information collected through this website on or after the effective date shown above. </p>

                <p>We believe that information used responsibly benefits consumers and the economy, whether it is information we house on behalf of consumers conducting transactions or information we collect on behalf of our business clients. For example, we use consumer information every day to ensure fast and accurate processing of thousands of electronic transactions. In addition, we strive to better serve our customers by offering goods and services that we believe fit their needs and interests. When identifying an opportunity, we may use aggregated consumer information in an effort to identify customers who may be interested in that opportunity.</p>

                <p>These policies guide us in the collection and use of information as well as setting our employee's responsibilities in protecting your privacy. We use personal information about consumers, customers and users only in a manner consistent with these policies.</p>

                <h4>   Cookies</h4>

                </ul>
                <p>Where such disclosure occurs, we will require these third parties to keep your information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we are permitted to use it.</p>
                <p>In addition, we may be required or permitted by law to use and disclose your personal information, (such as disclosures to law enforcement bodies and government agencies to prevent fraud or other malicious activities).

                <p>By giving us your electronic address/account, you consent to us sending to you commercial electronic messages in order to provide you with information and tell you about products and services, including those of third parties, which we consider may be of interest to you.

The card issuer institution may also seek cardholder personal information from us and forward it to the cardholder.</p>
                <p>Where information is collected by us directly from consumers or sources other than our business customers, we will permit such sources, if possible, to dispute or correct any erroneous, incomplete or out-of-date personally identifiable information.
